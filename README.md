### [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/sanicball/17385) Description
Sanicball is a stupid, silly racing game that throws away complex gameplay mechanics, character progression and microtransactions in favor of pure fast.

It features the all the latest* dumb internet memes thrown together in a blender to form a truly europhoic circlejerking experience. This wasn't the original intention but it ended up happening anyway.

This game is purely fan made, Sega or Sonic Team were not involved in creating this. Also, 'Sanic Team' and 'Notsega' are fictional companies.
